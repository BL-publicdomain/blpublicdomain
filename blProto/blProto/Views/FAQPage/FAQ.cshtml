    <p><b>Where is the background image taken from?</b></p>
    <p>The background image is taken from the book "<i>Lahore to Yārkand. Incidents of the route and natural history of the countries traversed by the expedition of 1870, under T. D. Forsyth, etc</i>" which can be found on Flickr <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/11098872356/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <p><b>What stopwords have been implemented into your OCR full text search?</b></p>
    <p>Stop words are "function words" such as <i>the, in, to</i>. The list of words that were excluded from the OCR text search can be found <a href="~/StopWordList/StopWordList" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <p><b>I've downloaded the OCR text .txt and it opened in Notepad with a layout that is difficult to read.</b></p>
    <p>This is because on Windows, Notepad does not read the files' line breaks. You can also open the text file with Microsoft Word (with, e.g. Unicode UTF-8 file conversion), as well as the free software <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>.</p>
